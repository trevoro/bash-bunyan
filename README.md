# Bash-Bunyan
This version uses associative arrays and requires bash version 4

This tool is based off [trentms](http://github.com/trentm) excellent [node-bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) utility. It's used for
creating structured logs using the JSON format. The output is JSON which can be
piped to either the 'bunyan' tool itself, or to another JSON parser or to a
file.

## Usage

To use bash-bunyan in your bash script, source the 'bunyan' script then use one
of the level names to log directly.
ex:

    $ cat example.sh
    #!/usr/bin/bash
    
    . includes/bunyan

    info "this is an info message"
    $
    ~
    $ sh example.sh | json 
    {
      "name": "example.sh",
      "hostname": "mac.local",
      "pid": 49121,
      "level": 30,
      "msg": "this is an info message",
      "time": "2012-03-24T02:48:21Z",
      "v": 0
    }

## Levels

When you include bunyan you will automatically inherit functions which
correspond to the log levels. These functions are

 * noset (0): logging from external libraries
 * debug (10): verbose debug information
 * info  (20): detail on regular information
 * warn  (30): something an operation should pay attention to
 * error (40): fatal for a request / action
 * critical (50): the application exited because of some error

To change the loglevel set the '\_\_bunyanLevel to the appropriate level you
care about. Anything under that level will not be logged. By default, the level
is set to 'info'.

## Settings

bash-bunyan doesn't have nearly the granularity of node-bunyan, but you can set
the name of the process reported in bunyan by setting:
bunyanFields[name] 

This variable will be set automatically in your script when you source
the bunyan include file.
ex:

    $ cat example2.sh
    #!/usr/bin/bash

    . includes/bunyan
    bunyanFields[name]+=super
    info 'hello world'
    ~
    $ sh example2.sh | bunyan
    [2012-03-24T02:47:15Z]  INFO: super/49105 on mac.local: hello world
    
Additional flags can also be set as seen in the example:

bunyanFields[user]+=`whoami`
